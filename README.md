üìä Turning Raw Sales Data into Business Insights | Power BI Story
In today‚Äôs data-driven world, it‚Äôs not about having more data ‚Äî it‚Äôs about finding the right insights that drive decisions.
I recently worked on a Global Electronics Retailers KPI Dashboard using a dataset from Kaggle to explore how sales, cost, and profit vary across countries, categories, and time.

üí° The Challenge
The dataset represented a global retail business selling electronics through both online and offline stores.
The goal was to answer a few critical business questions:
‚Ä¢	Which product categories bring the highest profit margins?
‚Ä¢	How do sales trends change across years and regions?
‚Ä¢	Are we meeting our profit targets?
‚Ä¢	What could next year‚Äôs sales look like?

‚öôÔ∏è My Approach
‚Ä¢	Built a clean data model in Power BI (star schema connecting Sales, Products, Stores, Customers & Calendar tables).
‚Ä¢	Created DAX measures for Total Sales, Profit, Cost, % Profit, Target Profit, and Forecasted Sales.
‚Ä¢	Added interactive filters for store type, product brand, category, and time period.
‚Ä¢	Designed visuals to tell a cohesive story ‚Äî from KPIs to deep-dive breakdowns.

üìà Insights Uncovered
‚Ä¢	Home Appliances emerged as the highest contributor to overall profit.
‚Ä¢	United States and United Kingdom led in sales volume, but some European markets had stronger profit ratios.
‚Ä¢	The Year-over-Year trend revealed significant growth in 2018‚Äì2019 before flattening post-2020.
‚Ä¢	Forecast analysis projected steady recovery aligned with global retail trends.

üéØ Business Impact
This dashboard acts as a decision-support system ‚Äî enabling stakeholders to:
‚Ä¢	Identify profitable product lines and underperforming regions
‚Ä¢	Adjust pricing strategies based on cost-profit insights
‚Ä¢	Plan future sales targets and budgets more accurately
In short, what started as raw transactional data transformed into a story of business performance, strategy, and growth.

DAX Measures: 
Total Sales =  SUMX(Sales,Sales[Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Unit Price USD]))/ 100

Total Cost = SUMX(Sales,Sales[Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Unit Cost USD]))/ 100

Forcaste Sales = 
VAR FOR_YEAR = CALCULATE(MAX('Calendar'[Year]) -1,ALL('Calendar')) // SAME AS SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR
VAR SALES_ = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Sales]),'Calendar'[Year] = FOR_YEAR)
VAR No_OF_MONTH = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('Calendar'[Month]),'Calendar'[Year] = FOR_YEAR)
VAR AVG_SALES = SALES_/No_OF_MONTH
RETURN AVG_SALES *12

SELECTED PROFIT = 
VAR selectyr = SELECTEDVALUE(Sales[Year of order])
RETURN
IF(ISBLANK(selectyr),[Total Profit],
ABS(
CALCULATE(SUMX(Sales, Sales[Quantity] * RELATED(Products[Profit per Unit]))/ 100, Sales[Year of order] = selectyr )))


TARGET PROFIT VALUE = 
VAR Selectyr = SELECTEDVALUE('Calendar'[Year])
VAR tar =
(CALCULATE(SUMX(Sales,Sales[Total Profit]),'Calendar'[Year] = Selectyr - 1) - CALCULATE(SUMX(Sales,Sales[Total Profit]),'Calendar'[Year]= YEAR(TODAY()) -6)) * 2
RETURN 
IF(ISBLANK(Selectyr),[Total Profit] * 2,ABS(tar))
